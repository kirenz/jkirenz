## Introduction to xaringan

- With xaringan you can easily generate HTML5 presentations.

- The xaringan package is an [R Markdown](https://www.kirenz.com/project/markdown-first-steps/) extension based on the JavaScript library remark.js.

- [Remark.js]((https://remarkjs.com) is an in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool.

- This presentation covers the basic functionalities of xaringan and is mainly based on [Yihui Xie's](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1) and [Alison Hill's](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/static/slides/rladies-demo-slides.Rmd) xaringan introductions.

- To learn more about xaringan, review the excellent [xaringan introduction](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) from the package's author Yihui Xi. 

---

## Installation of xaringan

* First of all, install the xaringan package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("xaringan")
```

- Create a new R Markdown document from the RStuido menu: 

 - `File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation`

- Use the [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/)<sup>1</sup> "Infinite Moon Reader" to live preview the slides.

- Every time you update and save the Rmd document, the slides will be automatically reloaded in RStudio Viewer.

- Review this site for more information about the [Infinite Moon Reader](https://yihui.name/en/2019/02/ultimate-inf-mr/)

.footnote[
[1] See [this comments](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/2) if you do not see the template or addin in RStudio. 
]

---

## Xaringan uses YAML metadata

.pull-left[

- The metadata (title page, style,...) for xaringan is written in between the pair of three dashes (`---`) at the top of the document.

- The syntax for the metadata is [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language, also called YAML metadata or the YAML frontmatter). 

- YAML metadata typically consists of tag-value pairs separated by colons. 

- The YAML metatdata for this document is shown at the right.

]

.pull-right[

```markdown
---
title: "Build Presentations in R"
subtitle: "with Xaringan"
author: "Jan Kirenz"
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
---
```

- Note that indentation matters in YAML, so do not forget to indent the sub-fields of a top field properly.

- Visit the online book [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/r-markdown.html) from Yihui Xi to learn more about YAML

]

---


## Slides and properties: class


.pull-left[

- Every new slide is created under a horizontal rule (`---`). 

- A slide can have properties, including `class` and `background-image`

- Properties have to be written in the beginning of a slide, e.g.:

]

.pull-right[

- Available **class** names are:

- `left`, `center`, and `right` for the **horizontal alignment** of all elements on a slide 

- `top`, `middle`, and `bottom` can be used for the **vertical alignment**.

]


```markdown
---
class: center, middle
background-image: url("images/cool.png")
```

---

## Slides and properties: background-image

.pull-left[

- Background images can be set via the `background-image` property. 

- The image can be either a local file or an online image. 

- The path should be put inside `url()`.

- You can also set the background image size and position, e.g.,

]

.pull-right[

- Available options are:

- **background-position**:`center`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `middle`, and `bottom` or use percentages to specify the exact location ( e.g. `10% 20%`) for the alignment on a slide 

- **size**: use `contain` to cover the whole page or use a specific number (e.g. `20%`) 

]

```markdown
background-image: url("https://path/picture.png")
background-position: center
background-size: contain
```

---

## Implementation of images

* You can use simple Markdown code to implement images: 

```markdown
![Image description](path/image.png)
```

![Image description](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg)

---

## Implementation of images

* You may also use the package `knitr` to specify more options: 

```r
{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='RStudio Logo'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://path/logo.svg')

```

<br />

```{r, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='RStudio Logo', echo=FALSE}
# hide this code in the output with echo=FALSE
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg')
```


---

## Implementation of images

* Or use HTML if you want to change the size of the image:

```markdown
<img src="path/image.png" width="200" height="200" />
```

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg" width="200" height="200" />

---

## Implementation of videos 

* You can easily embed videos in xaringan presentation. As an example here are the steps to implement YouTube-videos:

1. On a computer, go to the YouTube video you want to embed.
1. Under the video, click SHARE Share.
1. Click Embed.
1. From the box that appears, copy the HTML code.
1. Paste the code into your xaringan document


.center[

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJIrF4YjHfQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

]

---

## Content classes

- You can assign classes to any elements on a slide.

- The syntax is `.className[content]`. 

- Basically it makes it possible to style any elements on a slide via CSS. There are a few built-in content classes: 
 - `.left[ ]`, 
 - `.center[ ]`, and 
 - `.right[ ]`, 
 
 to align elements horizontally on a slide, e.g., you may center an image:

```markdown
.center[![description of the image](images/foo.png)]
```

---

## Content classes: sidebar layout

.left-column[

### Example of the sidebar layout

### ... with two level-3 headings

]

.right-column[
- The content inside `[ ]` can be anything, such as several paragraphs, or lists. 

- The default theme of **xaringan** has provided four more content classes:

- `.left-column[ ]` and `.right-column[ ]` provide a sidebar layout like the one on this page:

 - The left sidebar is narrow (20% of the slide width), and the right column is the main column (75% of the slide width). 

 - If you have multiple level-2 (`##`) or level-3 (`###`) headings in the left column, the last heading will be highlighted, with previous headings being grayed out.
]

---

## Content classes: two-column layout

- `.pull-left[ ]` and `.pull-right[ ]` provide a two-column layout, and the two columns are of the same width. Below is an example:

    ```markdown
    .pull-left[
    - One bullet.

    - Another bullet.
    ]

    .pull-right[
    ![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg)
    ]
    ```


.pull-left[
- One bullet.

- Another bullet.
    ]

.pull-right[
![an image](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/62bcc8535a06077094ca3c29c383e37ad7334311/a263f/assets/img/logo.svg)
    ]


---

## Content classes

- You can design your own content classes if you know CSS. 

- E.g., if you want to make text red via `.red[ ]`, you may define this in CSS:

```{css}
.red { color: red; }
```


- `.red[Text in red]` renders to .red[Text in red]


---

## Incremental slides

.pull-left[

* When you want to show content incrementally on a slide, you can use two dashes to separate the content. 

* The two dashes can appear anywhere except inside content classes, so you can basically split your content in any way you like.

* You can views the example code on the right on the next page

]

.pull-right[

```
## Incremental slides

The easiest way to build  
incremental slides is...
--
to use two dashes `--` to  
separate content on a slide.
--
You can divide a  
slide in _any way you want_.
--
- One bullet
- Another bullet
--
- And one more

## R Plots

* Implement R code with plots and change the figure size with `fig.height` and `fig.width` in the code chunk options:


```markdown
{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
```
```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) + geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

---

## R output

```r
{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
```
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(9.102360, 48.740760,  
                                     zoom = 17)
```


---


## Tables

* If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')
```

---

## Tables: DT package

* The R package DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables. 

* R data objects (matrices or data frames) can be displayed as tables on HTML pages.

* DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables.

* See this [DT-Table documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) for an overview of the different options.
---

## Tables: DT package

```{r}
library(DT)

DT::datatable(head(iris, 10),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 4))
```

---

## Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. `$\alpha+\beta$` renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).


---

## Highlight code

- The option `highlightLines: true` of `nature` will highlight code lines that end with `#<<` or are wrapped in `{{ }}`;

    ```yaml
    output:
      xaringan::moon_reader:
        nature:
          highlightLines: true
    ```

    See examples on the next page.

---

## Highlight code

* An example of using trailing comment #<< to highlight lines::

```{r}
a = 1
b = 2

c = a + b #<<
```


* An example using {{}}

```{r}
if (TRUE) {
{{ message("Very important!") }}
}
```

---


## R Code chunk Options


* `include = FALSE` prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.

```{r include = FALSE}
1 + 1
```

* `echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
1 + 1 
```


* `message = FALSE` prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.

* `warning = FALSE` prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.

## Comments

* You can write notes for yourself to read in the presenter mode. 

* Press the keyboard shortcut "p" while viewing the presentation. 

* These notes are written under three question marks ??? after a slide.

???

This comment is not visible in the HTML output slide.


---

## Keyboard shortcuts 

After opening slides generated from **xaringan**, you may press the key `h` (Help) or `?` on your keyboard to learn all possible keyboard shortcuts, which may help you better present your slides.

- To go the previous slide, you may press `Up`/`Left` arrows, `PageUp`, or `k`.

- To go the next slide, you may press `Right`/`Down` arrows, `PageDown`, `Space`, or `j`.

- You may press `Home` to go to the first slide, or `End` to go to the last slide, if you have these keys.

- Typing a number and pressing `Return` (or `Enter`), you can jump to a specific slide with that page number.

---

## Keyboard shortcuts 


- Press `b` to black out a slide.

- `m` to "mirror" a slide (reverse everything on the slide).

- Press `f` to toggle the fullscreen mode.

- Press `c` to clone the slides to a new browser window 

 - slides in the two windows will be in sync as you navigate through them. 
 
- Press `p` to toggle the presenter mode. 

- The keys `c` and `p` can be very useful when you present with your own computer connected to a second screen (such as a projector). On the second screen, you can show the normal slides, while cloning the slides to your own computer screen and using the presenter mode. 

- You may press `t` to restart the timer at any time.

- Press `h` or `?` again to exit the help page.
