# Lasso Regression

In statistics and machine learning, lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; also Lasso or LASSO) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))).
