A good place to start your journey into the basics of machine learning --the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed-- are the non-technical and easy to follow introductions to machine learning by Yufeng Guo from *Google's AI Adventures* video-series:

* [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

Google recently published a series of internal AI training resources originally developed for its engineers. The *crash course* provides a fast-paced and practical overview about the fundamental concepts of machine learning. Here you can learn and apply fundamental machine learning concepts, get real-world examples with the companion [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com), or visit [Learn with Google AI](https://ai.google/education/) to explore the full library of training resources.

* [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from Andrew Ng

In this excellent course from Andrew Ng, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:

* (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
* (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
* (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
