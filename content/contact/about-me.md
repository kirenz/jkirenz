I studied business administration with a focus on operations research and quantitative marketing at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/).

Afterwards, I received my doctoral degree from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html) (2010). During my doctoral studies, I attended quantitative methods and programming courses at the University of Zurich, [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk) (GB) and the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) (USA).
